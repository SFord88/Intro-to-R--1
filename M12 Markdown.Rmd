## Example of how to create an R Markdown document

This is an example of how to use R Markdown to create an html document.  
For example, I can **MAKE TEXT BOLD** and use *italics* or ~~strikethrough~~ or even superscript^superscript^

If I want to include code, I can use "```{}" to include code

```{r my_data}
a <- 5
b <- 10
c <- 15
d <- 20
my_data <- c(a,b,c,d)
sum(my_data)
mean(my_data)
```

## Including Plots

It is also possible to embed plots.  For this, I used the made up data for "my_data" that I used above:

```{r data, echo=TRUE}
plot(my_data)
```

The `echo = TRUE` parameter was used so that the R code would be printed.
